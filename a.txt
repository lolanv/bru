create a class Order with the following attributes:
1._id which indicates the id of the order instance and is a string value
2._value which indicates the order value(after discount) amount (in rupees) and is a float value
3._type which could be either PAID, COD OR PROMOTION
4._discount which is a float value indicating the discount amount on the order

create a relevent parameterised constructor to instantiate objects
Enable/disable special member functionsas per your requirements

Create the following functionalities in a functionalities.cpp file(with a suitable header file)
1.A function to create 5 objects on heap of order class and store their addresses in a list container(values entered manually without any user input).
2.A function to find and return the _id of the order whose _discount amount is the lowest. If theere are multiple lowest values, consider the first lowest found from the start of the data container
3.A function to find and return the _type of Order whose _id is passed as an argument
4.A function to find and return the average _value of all order units in the container.
5.A function to find and return the last N instances in the container where N is passed as a parameter to the function(pass manually without taking input from user).
Demonstrate each functionalities by creating a suitable main file
