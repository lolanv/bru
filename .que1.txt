    Create a function FillData to generate an RXC dimension array of integers where R & C represents row and column count respectively (taken as input from the user). Accept RXC inputs from the user and fill the array.
    For e.g.: The input sequence: 
    2
    2
    10
    20
    30
    40
    Should create this matrix of values
        10       20
        30       40
    Create an Adaptor function that accepts the following parameters:
        1.A value R representing the count of rows in the 2D array.
        2.A value C representing the count of columns in the 2D array.
        3.A pointer to an array of integers(representing the values generated in the FillData function)
        4.A function wrapper to any function matching the following signature
            -2 integer values (for R and C as described above) along with a pointer to an array of integers.
            -Return type of function should be void.
    Invoke the Adaptor function by passing the following functions as a parameters to it
        1.A function that takes the above matrix as input, and displays the sum of values in each row.
        for e.g. For the matrix above, console should display
            30
            70
        2.A function that displays the highest value from the input matrix on the console
        for e.g. For the matrix above console should display 40
        3.A lambda function that displays the square of number at the last position of the matrix
        for e.g. For the matrix above, console should display 1600
        4.A lambda function that prints the maximum number in each column of the above matrix
        for e.g. For the matrix above, console sould display 
            30
            40
        Create appropriate main function to demonstrate all functionalities.
